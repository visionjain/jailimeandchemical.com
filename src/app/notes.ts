/* 
For the fancy feature cards to have background patterns, 
please create or download these SVG pattern files and place them in your public directory:

1. leaf-pattern.svg - A subtle pattern with leaf or nature elements
2. shield-pattern.svg - A pattern with shield or security-related elements
3. wave-pattern.svg - A wavy pattern representing moisture/air
4. paint-pattern.svg - A pattern with brush strokes or texture elements
5. thermometer-pattern.svg - A pattern with temperature or climate elements
6. gear-pattern.svg - A pattern with gear or mechanical elements

These can be very subtle, low-opacity background elements that enhance
the visual appeal of each card while relating to its theme.
